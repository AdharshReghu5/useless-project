## Project Overview

TopperApp is a fun take on productivity tools by offering features intended to help but with a twist: rather than encouraging productivity, it provides procrastination prompts
and amusing notifications to “demotivate” the user. This project was created as part of a hackathon competition and includes features like:
- Randomized demotivational quotes on the home page
- A humorous wake-up alarm feature with popup notifications
- Assignment and record submission reminders with procrastination thoughts
- Workout reminders
- Study timetable and exam reminders with additional procrastination thoughts

## Features

- **Wakeup Alarm**: Set an alarm with a user-friendly interface and a popup notification.
- **Assignment Submission**: Set deadlines for assignments with procrastination thoughts displayed for each.
- **Record Submission**: Add records to be submitted by a specific date with a countdown timer and demotivational quotes.
- **Workout Reminder**: Set regular reminders to “work out” with procrastination prompts.
- **Study Timetable**: Create a timetable for study sessions and get notified to procrastinate effectively.
